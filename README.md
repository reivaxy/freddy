This is a work in progress.

My goal is to design a set of pieces that are easy to print (no support is needed), and easy to assemble in order to build Freddy Krueger's famous clawed glove.

The claws (or blades) should be printed with grey or silver-like filament, and the finger pieces in brownish or bronze filament.

Each finger can be easily parametered.
