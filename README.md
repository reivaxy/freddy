# freddy

My goal was to design a set of pieces that are easy to print (no support is needed), and easy to assemble in order to build Freddy Krueger's famous clawed glove, so the design is simplified.

The claws (or blades) should be printed with grey or silver-like filament, and the finger pieces in brownish or bronze filament.

Each finger can be easily parametered with 2 diameters for each half finger, the lenghts of upper and lower fingers, and the length and width of the band to tie the finger to the hand plate.

Here is the final print, using grey and bronze PLA, and wiping some acrylic paint on it so that it does not look to new.

Admittedly, the sweater needs some work :)
